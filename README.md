# Detecting Fake News using Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can detect fake news articles with high accuracy. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled news articles and uses natural language processing techniques to extract features and classify articles as either fake or real.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You will also need to install the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn
- nltk

You can install these libraries using pip, as follows:

```
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install sklearn
pip install nltk
```

Once you have installed the required libraries, you can run the fake news detection model by running the `fake_news_detection.py` file. The model will prompt you to enter a news article, and it will then classify the article as either fake or real.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `fake_news_detection.py` - This is the main script that runs the fake news detection model.
- `fake_news.csv` - This is the dataset of labeled news articles used to train the model.
- `data_processing.py` - This module contains functions for processing and cleaning the news article data.
- `feature_extraction.py` - This module contains functions for extracting features from the news article data.
- `model_training.py` - This module contains functions for training and evaluating the machine learning model.
