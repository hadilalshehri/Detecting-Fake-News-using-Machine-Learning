# Detecting Fake News using Machine Learning

This project was for Machine learning course that  aims to develop a machine learning model that can detect fake news articles with high accuracy. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled news articles and uses natural language processing techniques to extract features and classify articles as either fake or real using different machine learning model Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classification, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes in order to compare between them.

- The data set is e ISOT Fake News dataset

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You will also need to install the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn
- string
- re
- math
- seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip, as follows:

```
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install sklearn
pip install nltk
pip install re
pip install math
pip install seaborn
```

Once you have installed the required libraries, you can run the fake news detection model by running the `fake_news_detection.py` file. The model will prompt you to enter a news article, and it will then classify the article as either fake or real.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `fake_news_detection.py` - This is the main script that runs the fake news detection models.
- `Main.ipynb` -  This is  Jupyter Notebook  that runs the fake news detection models.
